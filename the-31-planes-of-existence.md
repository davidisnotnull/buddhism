# The 31 Planes of Existence

Scattered throughout the suttas are references to as many as thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during their long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily grim and painful hell realms all the way up to the most exquisitely refined and blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is temporary; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to their past karma. When they pass away, they take rebirth once again elsewhere according to the quality of their karma: wholesome actions bring about a favorable rebirth, while unwholesome actions lead to an unfavorable one. And so the wearisome cycle continues.

The realms of existence are customarily divided into three distinct "worlds" \(loka\), listed here in descending order of refinement:

> The Immaterial World \(arupa-loka\). Consists of four realms that are accessible to those who pass away while meditating in the formless jnanas.
>
> The Fine-Material World \(rupa-loka\). Consists of sixteen realms whose inhabitants \(the devas\) experience extremely refined degrees of mental pleasure. These realms are accessible to those who have attained at least some level of jnana and who have thereby managed to \(temporarily\) suppress hatred and ill-will. They are said to possess extremely refined bodies of pure light. The highest of these realms, the Pure Abodes, are accessible only to those who have attained to "non-returning," the third stage of Awakening. The Fine-Material World and the Immaterial World together constitute the "heavens" \(sagga\).
>
> The Sensuous World \(kama-loka\). Consists of eleven realms in which experience — both pleasurable and not — is dominated by the five senses. Seven of these realms are favorable destinations, and include our own human realm as well as several realms occupied by devas. The lowest realms are the four "bad" destinations, which include the animal and hell realms.

## The Immaterial World \(arupa-loka\)

The inhabitants of these realms are possessed entirely of mind. Having no physical body, they are unable to hear Dharma teachings.

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(31\) Neither-perception-nor-non-perception \(nevasaññanasaññayatanupaga deva\) | Fourth formless jnana |
| \(30\) Nothingness \(akiñcaññayatanupaga deva\) | Third formless jnana |
| \(29\) Infinite Consciousness \(viññanañcayatanupaga deva\) | Second formless jnana |
| \(28\) Infinite Space \(akasanañcayatanupaga deva\) | First formless jnana |

## The Fine-Material World \(rupa-loka\)

These are the five Pure Abodes \(suddhavasa\), which are accessible only to non-returners \(anagami\) and arahants. Beings who become non-returners in other planes are reborn here, where they attain arahantship.

Among its inhabitants is Brahma Sahampati, who begs the Buddha to teach Dharma to the world.

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(27\) Peerless devas \(akanittha deva\) | Fourth jnana |
| \(26\) Clear-sighted devas \(sudassi deva\) | Fourth jnana |
| \(25\) Beautiful devas \(sudassa deva\) | Fourth jnana |
| \(24\) Untroubled devas \(atappa deva\) | Fourth jnana |
| \(23\) Devas not Falling Away \(aviha deva\) | Fourth jnana |

Only body is present; no mind.

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(22\) Unconscious beings \(asaññasatta\) | Fourth jnana |

Beings in these planes enjoy varying degrees of jnanic bliss.

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(21\) Very Fruitful devas \(vehapphala deva\) | Fourth jnana |
| \(20\) Devas of Refulgent Glory \(subhakinna deva\) | Third jnana \(highest degree\) |
| \(19\) Devas of Unbounded Glory \(appamanasubha deva\) | Third jnana \(medium degree\) |
| \(18\) Devas of Limited Glory \(parittasubha deva\) | Third jnana \(minor degree\) |
| \(17\) Devas of Streaming Radiance \(abhassara deva\) | Second jnana \(highest degree\) |
| \(16\) Devas of Unbounded Radiance \(appamanabha deva\) | Second jnana \(medium degree\) |
| \(15\) Devas of Limited Radiance \(parittabha deva\) | Second jnana \(minor degree\) |

One of this realm's most famous inhabitants is the Great Brahma, a deity whose delusion leads him to regard himself as the all-powerful, all-seeing creator of the universe 

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(14\) Great Brahmas \(Maha brahma\) | First jnana \(highest degree\) |

Beings in these planes enjoy varying degrees of jnanic bliss.

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(13\) Ministers of Brahma \(brahma-purohita deva\) | First jnana \(medium degree\) |
| \(12\) Retinue of Brahma \(brahma-parisajja deva\) | First jnana \(minor degree\) |

## The Sensuous World \(kama-loka\)

### Happy Destinations \(Sugati\)

These devas enjoy sense pleasures created by others for them. Mara, the personification of delusion and desire, lives here.

**You are here** \(for now\).

Rebirth as a human being is extraordinarily rare. It is also extraordinarily precious, as its unique balance of pleasure and pain facilitates the development of virtue and wisdom to the degree necessary to set one free from the entire cycle of rebirths.

### States of Deprivation \(Apaya\)

The demons — "titans" — that dwell here are engaged in relentless conflict with each other.

| Realm | Cause of rebirth |
| :--- | :--- |
| \(4\) Asuras \(asura\) | Ten unwholesome actions |

Ghosts and unhappy spirits wander hopelessly about this realm, searching in vain for sensual fulfillment.

These are realms of unimaginable suffering and anguish. Should not be confused with the eternal hell found in other religious traditions, since one's time here is — as it is in every realm — temporary.
